=========================
A basic angular.js chess MMO using unicode pieces and socket.io to synchronize every client.

There are no rules (for now). Just chess pieces on a checkered board, and n number of spectators/participants.

Think of it like a chessboard in the middle of the park. Anything can happen. Minus the total lack of culpability from being on the internet.
